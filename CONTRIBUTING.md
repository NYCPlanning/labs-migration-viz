## üéâ Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a Planning Labs open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask ‚Äî or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

If you have any questions or want to read more, check out the [NYC Planning Labs Open Source Policy GitHub repository](https://github.com/NYCPlanning/labs-open-source-policy), or just [shoot us an email](mailto:labs_dl@planning.nyc.gov).

## üõ† Create a branch

This repository has two evergreen branches: `master` and `develop`
 (avoid directly committing changes to these two branches).

| Branch | Notes |
| ------ | ----- |
| `master` | Master is always deployable and only accepts merges from `develop`. |
| `develop` | Accepts merges from feature and issue branches. |
| Feature/Issues | Always branch off `HEAD` of `develop`. Prefix feature branches with your name (e.g. `user-feature_name`). Prefix issue branches with the issue number (e.g. `123-issue_name`). |
| Hotfixes | In rare cases, hotfix branches must be created to quickly update the project. Always branch off `master` and make sure those changes make it back into develop. |

## ü§ì Be cool

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Planning Labs follows the [18F Code of Conduct](https://github.com/18F/code-of-conduct/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and all contributors should do the same.
