# NYC Historic Migration Data Visualization
A single-page interactive visualization of historic U.S. Census migration data for New York City 


## About
This labs project is a single page interactive data visualization of historic census migration data.  The project's goals are as follows:
1. To create a compelling web experience for exploring NYC migration trends data, in support of a broader initiative by the population division highlighting migration patterns.
2. To create a re-usable template for future single-page dataviz projects, and a fully-functional project that can be used for learning basic web development and data visualization with d3.js.
